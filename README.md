# Title: WC6_JSQuiz

Working with Web APIs: Code Quiz app 

## Project Lead: Wojciech J. Koloska

This timed quiz was created to fulfill 6th Bootcamp chalenge.
This chalenge was targetting JS skills and ability to work with API's.
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
"Commented" test points were left in addition to standard comments in JS file;
allowing future tracebility of logic in the code , as In the future I would like recreate 
same application using different style/methods (ex. jquery syntax to improve the code).
